# see https://github.com/starship/starship/issues/597
#
# the root issue seems to be upstream
# [git2-rs](https://github.com/rust-lang/git2-rs) which itself apparently uses
# [libgit2](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/issues/5038)
#
# Note that there's an alternative that is aimed at the specific issue of
# status prompts at [gitstatus](https://github.com/romkatv/gitstatus); perhaps
# this could be turned into a crate that starship could use?
